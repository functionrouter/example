# Example - Deploy an OpenWhisk Execution Endpoint

Since OpenWhisk is an open source project, it is easily deployable in locations other than IBM Bluemix that might be physically closer to a client application.  In this step, you will deploy an instance of OpenWhisk on a virtual machine on a host of your choosing with Vagrant.

First, [follow the instructions for installing Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/).

Next, for your convenience, two different Vagrantfile variations have been modified from the OpenWhisk trunk and provided as part of this example:

* [VirtualBox](./virtualbox/Readme.md)
* [AWS](./aws/Readme.md)
